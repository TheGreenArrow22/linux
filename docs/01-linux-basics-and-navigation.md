# 01 – Linux Basics and Navigation

These commands are foundational. If you cannot explain what each does, stop here.

## Working directory and identity

```bash
pwd
whoami
````

## Navigating the filesystem

```bash
cd /etc
cd ..
cd ../..
cd ../../..
cd /
```

## Listing files and directories

```bash
ls
ls /etc
ls -l
ls -la
```

Hidden files are not suspicious by default. Context matters.

## Manual pages

Every serious command has documentation:

```bash
man ls
man find
man ps
```
