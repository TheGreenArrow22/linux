# 00 – Overview

This repository provides a structured Linux hardening baseline rooted in:

- Command-line visibility
- CIS Benchmark guidance
- Practical threat modeling

Sections progress from fundamentals to deep hardening:

1. Core Linux navigation and literacy
2. Process and system inspection
3. Package and kernel management
4. Firewalling and auditing
5. CIS-aligned filesystem, service, SSH, and kernel controls

You are expected to:

- Read before running commands
- Understand service dependencies
- Validate each change

Linux gives you rope. This repository teaches you where not to hang yourself.
